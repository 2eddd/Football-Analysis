# Football-Analysis
As a fan of Football, I try to learn and visualize different data collected, using different statistical approach and machine learning methods.
I tried to do something of my own, a little task to be more precise. 
At first I collected the data from the official Premier League site. The data is the points table of the season 2021-22.
After that, I tried to visualize it by plotting a bar chart of the teams with respect to the total numbers of points scored in that season. 
Then created a scatterplot to see the performance of each team. The crosshairs show the averages and it helps us to group teams accordingly.
And at the last, created a pie chart to see the distribution of the number of games won by each team.
